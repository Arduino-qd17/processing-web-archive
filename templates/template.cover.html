        <p>Processing is a programming language, development environment, and online 
           community. Since 2001, Processing has promoted software literacy within the 
           visual arts and visual literacy within technology. Initially created to serve 
           as a software sketchbook and to teach computer programming fundamentals within 
           a visual context, Processing evolved into a development tool for professionals. 
           Today, there are tens of thousands of students, artists, designers, researchers, 
           and hobbyists who use Processing for learning, prototyping, and production.
