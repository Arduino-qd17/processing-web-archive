        <p>Processing is an open source programming language and environment for 
        people who want to create images, animations, and interactions. Initially 
        developed to serve as a software sketchbook and to teach fundamentals of 
        computer programming within a visual context, Processing also has evolved 
        into a tool for generating finished professional work. Today, there are tens 
        of thousands of students, artists, designers, researchers, and hobbyists who 
        use Processing for learning, prototyping, and production.
