Documentation Java-Generate
===========================

Java-generate is built on top of Javadoc in order to semi-automate the
generation of Processing's documentation for distribution and the web.

Since it uses Javadoc, we need to be able to find the Processing source
code. If you clone both Processing and Processing-Web to the same directory,
you should be good to go.

In other words, these two repositories should live side-by-side:
processing/
processing-web/
