			<strong>Overview</strong>
		</p>

		<p>
			The Processing Foundation has a broad mission, but we take specific action. 
			We're broadly charged with developing free, open-source software tools for
			the visual arts. Our goal is to promote software literacy within the visual
			arts and to promote visual literacy within technology. We act by developing 
			and distributing the Processing software; both the core Application 
			Programming Interface (API) and the programming environment, the Processing 
			Development Environment (PDE). The board of the Processing Foundation is Ben 
			Fry, Casey Reas, and Dan Shiffman.

			Prior to incorporating as a foundation, Processing received key funding and 
			support from a few of organizations and companies. This commitment has enabled 
			a series of key improvements to the software. We hope to initiate more 
			relationships in the future. The Interactive Telecommunications Program at New 
			York University sponsored a Processing 2.0 development workshop in Summer 2011. 
			The Armstrong Institute for Interactive Media Studies at Miami University 
			funded The Oxford Project, a series of Processing development workshops 
			during the 2008-2009 academic year. These four-day meetings in Oxford, Ohio 
			enabled the November 2008 launch of Processing 1.0 and stimulated future 
			development. Oblong Industries funded Ben Fry to develop Processing during 
			summer 2008. This funding provided the means to complete the 1.0 release in 
			November 2008. Ben Fry received a 2006 Media Arts Fellowship, funded by the 
			Rockefeller Foundation. This grant was the first time Ben was able to work on 
			Processing as a funded project. This led to further developments of the OpenGL 
			and PDF rendering engines, as well as significant enhancements to other 
			libraries and their integration. In summer 2003, The Interaction Design 
			Institute Ivrea funded four individuals to work on Processing. This resulted 
			in Dan Mosedale's preprocessor using Antlr, Sami Arola's contributions to the 
			graphics engine and other contribution to the Processing Development 
			Environment and 2D graphics engine. We are grateful to Gillian Crampton Smith 
			for her encouragement.
