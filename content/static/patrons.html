		<h2>Overview</h2>

		<p>
			The Processing Foundation has a broad mission, but we take specific action. 
			We're charged with developing free, open-source software tools for the visual 
			arts. Our goal is to promote software literacy within the visual arts and to 
			promote visual literacy within technology. We act by developing and 
			distributing the Processing software; both the core Application Programming 
			Interface (API) and the programming environment, the Processing Development 
			Environment (PDE). The board of the Processing Foundation is Ben Fry, Casey 
			Reas, and Dan Shiffman.
		</p>

		<p>
			To succeed, the Foundation needs to raise money to support future versions
			of the Processing software and related initiatives. The Processing team, 
			<a href="http://www.processing.org/about/people/">a small group of volunteers</a> 
			have released over 200 versions of the software since 2001, leading 
			to the 2.0 release in Spring 2013. With almost no funding between the 1.0 and 
			2.0 releases, the software was written slowly while the developers managed
			many other responsibilities and full-time work. The 2.0 software release 
			happened in an unsustainable way, at tremendous personal expense to the lead 
			developers. The Foundation must succeed in raising funds for the initiative 
			to continue.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			The initial goal is to hire one full-time developer to maintain and build
			the Processing code base, while the current Processing team continues to 
			volunteer time to the project. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
			With the 2.0 release, we're now asking for donations from individuals who use 
			the software and we're actively seeking larger donations from individuals, 
			companies, and other non-profit organizations.

			Prior to incorporating as a Foundation, Processing received key funding and 
			support from a few of organizations and companies. This commitment enabled 
			a series of key improvements to the software. We hope to initiate more 
			relationships in the future. The Interactive Telecommunications Program at New 
			York University sponsored a Processing 2.0 development workshop in Summer 2011. 
			The Armstrong Institute for Interactive Media Studies at Miami University 
			funded The Oxford Project, a series of Processing development workshops 
			during the 2008-2009 academic year. These four-day meetings in Oxford, Ohio 
			enabled the November 2008 launch of Processing 1.0 and stimulated future 
			development. Oblong Industries funded Ben Fry to develop Processing during 
			summer 2008. This funding provided the means to complete the 1.0 release in 
			November 2008. Ben Fry received a 2006 Media Arts Fellowship, funded by the 
			Rockefeller Foundation. This grant was the first time Ben was able to work on 
			Processing as a funded project. This led to further developments of the OpenGL 
			and PDF rendering engines, as well as significant enhancements to other 
			libraries and their integration. In summer 2003, The Interaction Design 
			Institute Ivrea funded four individuals to work on Processing. This resulted 
			in Dan Mosedale's preprocessor using Antlr, Sami Arola's contributions to the 
			graphics engine and other contribution to the Processing Development 
			Environment and 2D graphics engine. We are grateful to Gillian Crampton Smith 
			for her encouragement.
